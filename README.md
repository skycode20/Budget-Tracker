  ## Description    

  The Budget Tracker is an aplication in which the user can easily track their expenses. The user enters in their budget and just subtracts each transaction from the total amount available to use. The progress is shown via graph for the user to be able to track their spending seamlessly.

  My inspiration for this project was to develop an application that helps a fiscally-conscious person get a handle on their spending. Promoting financial literacy is important especially with millenials. Milennials are visual and like to see graphs detail relevant data. 

  In the future I would like this application to be standalone for use on a phone. I can see it working in conjunction with a mobile banking application automatically tracking the budget and updating the spending and feeding that information into the graph.

  ## Installation    

    To install the **Budget-Tracker** please follow these steps:

  1. Download all of the project's source files `(clone the GitHub repository)`.
  2. Ensure your terminal is inside of the current folder that contains the source files.
  3. Install the following **NPMs** `(Node Package Managers)` in the system terminal:
        * Node.js
        * Enter ```npm i``` that will install all of the packages within the `package.json` file necessary to run the application. 

    Once all of that has been completed, run ```node server.js``` to initiate the program.

  ## Usage    

  Once the application has been booted up, the user can enter the name of the item they're purchasing and press `subtract funds` to subtract the cost of the good from the budget. Then the user can add funds to the budget in any dollar amount by adding a name to the budget increase `(grocery shopping)` and pressing `add funds`. This allows anyone to track their expenses over time. This application also works offline so that if the user doesn't have an internet connection, they can still budget properly and once a connection is established it will update the database via the `indexedDB`.
